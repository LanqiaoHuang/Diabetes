# Diabetes

[![CRAN Status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/Diabetes)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Diabetes)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

**Diabetes** is an R package designed to predict the risk of diabetes using pretrained machine learning models. It incorporates three popular algorithms: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Users can easily input patient clinical features and obtain both the probability of diabetes risk and a binary classification result.

This package eliminates the need for users to train models from scratch, providing a ready-to-use, reliable tool for diabetes risk assessment.

---

## Features

- **Pretrained Models:** No need for model training; utilize well-validated pretrained models.  
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Supports Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM for flexible prediction.  
- **Probability & Threshold:** Outputs probabilistic predictions with customizable classification thresholds.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple input format and clear, interpretable output.  
- **Extensible:** Easily integrate into larger clinical data analysis workflows.

## Installation

The package is currently not available on CRAN. You can install the development version from GitHub using the `devtools` package:

```r
# Install devtools if not already installed
install.packages("devtools")

# Install Diabetes package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("your_github_username/Diabetes")
```
Alternatively, to install from local source, navigate to the package root directory and run:
```r
devtools::install()
```
Usage
The main function provided by this package is predict_diabetes(), which performs diabetes risk prediction based on patient features.

Example
```r
# Sample patient data
patient_data <- data.frame(
  Pregnancies = c(2, 0),
  Glucose = c(120, 85),
  BloodPressure = c(70, 65),
  SkinThickness = c(20, 30),
  Insulin = c(79, 88),
  BMI = c(31.0, 25.5),
  DiabetesPedigreeFunction = c(0.5, 0.3),
  Age = c(45, 32)
)

# Predict using the default Random Forest model
pred_rf <- predict_diabetes(patient_data)
print(pred_rf)

# Predict using Logistic Regression model with threshold 0.4
pred_glm <- predict_diabetes(patient_data, model_type = "glm", threshold = 0.4)
print(pred_glm)

# Predict using Support Vector Machine with threshold 0.6
pred_svm <- predict_diabetes(patient_data, model_type = "svm", threshold = 0.6)
print(pred_svm)
```
Function Reference
predict_diabetes(newdata, threshold = 0.5, model_type = "rf")
Description
Predicts diabetes risk for new patient data using pretrained machine learning models.

Arguments
newdata
A data.frame containing the patient features required for prediction. The following columns are mandatory:

Feature	Type	Description
Pregnancies	numeric	Number of times pregnant
Glucose	numeric	Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure	numeric	Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness	numeric	Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin	numeric	Serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI	numeric	Body Mass Index
DiabetesPedigreeFunction	numeric	Diabetes pedigree function
Age	numeric	Age in years

threshold
Numeric value between 0 and 1 (default 0.5). Probability above this threshold is classified as "Yes" (diabetic), otherwise "No".

model_type
Character string specifying which pretrained model to use. Options are:

"rf": Random Forest (default)
"glm": Logistic Regression
"svm": Support Vector Machine
Returns
A data.frame containing the original input features plus two additional columns:

Pred_Prob: Predicted probability of diabetes (numeric, 0 to 1).
Pred_Class: Predicted class label as a factor with levels "No" and "Yes".
Details
The function loads pretrained model objects stored inside the package and applies them to the new data. The SVM model is trained with probability estimates enabled for probabilistic output.

Input data must be preprocessed correctly with no missing values to avoid errors.
Dependencies
The package relies on the following R packages, which will be installed automatically if missing:

randomForest — for Random Forest model
e1071 — for Support Vector Machine model
stats — for Logistic Regression model (base R)
